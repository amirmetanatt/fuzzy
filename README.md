## k-nearest neighbors (KNN) algorithm

This repository contains Python code for implementing k-NN and Fuzzy k-NN classifiers. These classifiers are applied to synthetic data generated using the `make_blobs` function from scikit-learn. The k-NN classifier is a simple algorithm that classifies a data point based on the majority class among its k nearest neighbors. The Fuzzy k-NN classifier, on the other hand, uses a fuzzy approach to assign membership values to each class for a given data point, considering the distances to its k nearest neighbors.

### Motivation
The motivation behind this project is to provide a clear and simple implementation of these classifiers for educational and demonstration purposes. Both k-NN and Fuzzy k-NN are widely used in machine learning for classification tasks and understanding their implementation can help in grasping the fundamentals of these algorithms.

### How to Use
To use the code in this repository, you will need Python 3.x along with NumPy and scikit-learn libraries. You can clone the repository and run the provided scripts to see the classifiers in action on synthetic data. The examples provided in the scripts demonstrate how to use these classifiers and visualize the results.

### Examples
- `knn_classifier.py`: Contains the implementation of the k-NN classifier and examples of using it on synthetic data.
- `fuzzy_knn_classifier.py`: Contains the implementation of the Fuzzy k-NN classifier and examples of using it on synthetic data.
- `visualization.py`: Contains examples of visualizing the classification results using matplotlib.
